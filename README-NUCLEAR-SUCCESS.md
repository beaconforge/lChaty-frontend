# ✅ lChaty Frontend - Simple HTTP Setup

## 🚀 Quick Start (Nuclear Rebuild Success!)

This setup has been completely rebuilt from the ground up with a simple, reliable HTTP-only configuration.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (tested with recent versions)
- npm

### Start Development Server
```powershell
# Simple one-command startup
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server will start on **http://localhost:3000** and auto-open your browser.

### Alternative: Use PowerShell Script  
```powershell
.\scripts\start-simple.ps1
```

### Run Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
npm run e2e

# Run only infrastructure tests (recommended first)
npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts --grep "renders required elements|theme toggle|show password|responsive layout|enhanced login"
```

## 🎯 What's Working

✅ **Vite 5.4.20** - Latest stable version  
✅ **HTTP dev server** - No SSL complexity  
✅ **Multi-page setup** - Both user and admin portals  
✅ **TypeScript + TailwindCSS** - Full dev stack  
✅ **Playwright E2E testing** - 12/12 infrastructure tests passing  
✅ **Responsive design** - Mobile and desktop layouts  
✅ **Theme switching** - Light/dark modes  
✅ **Clean PowerShell scripts** - No certificate dependencies

```

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Dev Server**: http://localhost:3000  
- **Vite Config**: Simple HTTP-only setup in `vite.config.ts`
- **Tests**: Configured for localhost HTTP in `playwright.config.ts`
- **No SSL**: All certificate complexity removed

## 🆙 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

This foundation is solid and ready for:

1. **Backend Integration** - API connections
2. **HTTPS Layer** - Can be added on top if needed  
3. **Production Build** - `npm run build`
4. **Additional Features** - Build on this stable base
