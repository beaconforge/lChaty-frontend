<!-- CERT POLICY SNIPPET: Do not modify certificates or security-related scripts without explicit approval -->
### Certificate & Security Policy (Important)

- Do NOT create, modify, delete, or trust any certificates, keys, or certificate stores unless you have explicit written approval from the project owner.
- Any changes to certificates, trust stores, or security scripts must be coordinated, reviewed, and committed separately with an audit note.
- If you need to perform certificate-related work, create an issue or request, get approval, then proceed using the documented scripts under the supervision of an admin.

This file is a policy snippet used to make the policy visible in key documentation and scripts.
